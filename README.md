# Multiverse
A Balatro mod I made because I was bored and needed something to work on.
This mod introduces:
 - New Jokers that reference other media (primarily games), somewhat balanced compared to vanilla Jokers
 - A new "transmutation" mechanic that transmutes Jokers into more powerful Transmuted Jokers that exceed the power of Legendary jokers
 - Enhancements, Seals and Stickers associated with these Transmuted Jokers that fundamentally change how a run will play out
 - Crazy Tarot, Planet, and Spectral cards that have the potential to make (or break) a run
